<h1>HAIR STYLES</h1>
<h3>Your Best Hair Styles. Love It</h3>
<p>A hairstyle, hairdo, haircut, or coiffure refers to the styling of hair, usually on the
 human head but sometimes on the face or body. The fashioning of hair can be considered an 
aspect of personal grooming, fashion, and cosmetics, although practical, cultural, and popular 
considerations also influence some hairstyles.
The oldest known depiction of hair styling is hair braiding, which dates back about 30,00
0 years. Women's hair was often elaborately and carefully dressed in special ways, though 
it was also frequently kept covered outside the home, especially for married women.</p>

<h3>STYLES OF HAIR STYLING</h3>
<ol>

Name	Image	Description
<li>Bob cut		A classic short hairstyle where it is cut above the shoulders in a blunt cut with typically no layers. This style is most common among women.</li>
<li	>Bouffant		A style distinguished by smooth hair that is heightened and given extra fullness over teasing in the fringe area.</li>
<li>Bowl cut		Named for the shape of the style as much as for a once-common method of achieving it (i.e. using a bowl to style the 
cut by placing it on the head and trimming the open hair). Moe Howard from The Three Stooges has this hairstyle for his trademark and Henry
	 V of England had a similar hairstyle. This hairstyle was popular in the United States (for straight hair textures) during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</li>
<li>Broccoli haircut		Named for its visual similarity to a floret of broccoli. It is associated with boys in Generation Z and gained 
	popularity through Internet memes on TikTok.</li>
<li>Bunches		Another name for pigtails worn braided or unbraided.</li>
<li>Butch cut		A butch is a type of haircut in which the hair on the top of the head is cut short in every dimension
. The top and the upper portion of the back and sides are cut the same length, which generally ranges between 5 millimeters (
.25 in) and 20 millimetres (.75 in), following the contour of the head. The hair below the upper portion of the sides and back 
of the head is tapered short or semi-short with a clipper, in the same manner as a crew cut.</li>
<li>Buzz cut		A buzz cut, or wiffle cut, whereby the hair is very short and typically cut with manual hair clippers.</li>
<li>Caesar cut		The Caesar cut is a men's hairstyle that is cut to a regular fade with the bangs or fringe left longer than the top length.</li>
<li>Chonmage		A variation on the traditional topknot and tonsure of samurai in Feudal Japan, today worn by sumo wrestlers. Unlike the 
samurai tonsure, the top of the head is never shaved for this hairstyle.</li>
<li>Comb over		Hair that is combed from one part of the head to another, often to cover up a bald spot.</li>
<li>Comma hair		Styling the hair or bangs into a curved comma formation.</li>
		<li>Conk		A hairstyle where Afro-textured hair is straightened. This was popular among African-American men from the 1920s to 1960s.</li>
<li>Crew cut		A crew cut or G.I. haircut is a type of haircut in which the hair on the top of the head is cut relatively short, 
measured in length from the longest hair that forms a short pomp (pompadour) at the front hairline to the shortest at the back of the
 crown. The hair on the sides and back of the head is usually tapered short, semi-short or medium.</li>
<li>Curtained hair		Curtained hair is the term given to the hairstyle featuring a long fringe divided in either a midd
le parting or a side parting. The hairstyle was popular on adolescents and men from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s.</li>
		<li>Dido flip		A "short choppy shag", popularized by British pop singer Dido.</li>
<li>Ducktail		A hairstyle predominantly favored by men, though some young female fans of Elvis Presley wore a similar look in his heyday.</li>
The style required that the hair were combed back around the sides of the head. The teeth edge of a comb was then used to define a central parti
ng flowing from the crown to the nape at the back of the head, resembling, to many, the rear end of a duck. The hair on the top front of the head 
was usually that of a pompadour. The sides on back were styled to resemble the folded wings of the duck.</li>

<li>Edgar cut		A short hairstyle where the front hair has bangs and the sides are tapered. This style is most common among Latinos.</li>
<li>Eton crop		A more extensive version of a short crop, with the hair at the back cut close and the front hair left longer for styling.</li>
<li>Fauxhawk		Also known as the 'fashion punk cut', the hairstyle is an approximation of a mohawk made without shaving or 'buzzing' th
e hair on the sides of the head, thus allowing an imitation of the look of a real mohawk not having to commit to removing most of one's hair. 
The name is a portmanteau of faux, the French word for false or fake, and 'mohawk'.</li>
<li>Flattop		A type of crew cut where the hair on the top of the head is cut as a flat plane giving a levelled 'flat-topped' look.</li>
	<li>French Crop		A haircut which is short at the sides and back, and medium length at the crown, worn with a fringe.</li>
<li>Frosted tips		A men's hairstyle (though women have adopted as well) in which the hair is cut short and formed into sh
ort spikes with hair gel or hair spray. The hair is bleached such that the tips of each spike will be light blond, usually in contr
ast to the wearer's main hair color. Frosted tips were prominent throughout the late 1990s. The style, without the coloring was 
also common and commonly just called "short and spiky".</li>
	<li>Hi-top fade		The hair is cut short on the sides and is grown long on the top. This style was popular among African-Americ
an youth and men in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</li>
<li>High and tight		A military variant of the crew cut.</li>
<li>Induction Cut		A haircut given to recruits being inducted into military service. It is similar to a buzz cut.</li>
<li>Ivy League		An Ivy League, also known as a Harvard Clip or Princeton, is a type of crew cut in which the hair on the t
op of the head is long enough to style with a side part.</li>
<li>Marcel waves		Deep waves made in short hair by a heated curling iron.
<li>Mohawk		Hair that is shaved or buzzed on the sides leaving a strip of hair in the middle. It is often spiked up.
<li>Mop-Top		A mid-length haircut that has a fringe (bangs) that brushes over the forehead, collar length at back, with the ears partly covered by the hair, dependent on style. Was made popular by The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr)
	<li>Pageboy		A longer version of a bob, typically worn with a fringe (bangs) and reaching shoulder-length or a bit longer.</li>
<li>Pixie cut		A very short women's hairstyle with or without a shaggy fringe (bangs).</li>
<li>Pompadour		The hair is swept upwards from the face and worn high over the forehead, and sometimes upswept around the sides and back as well.
 The style, named after Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), mistress of King Louis XV, is for both women and men.</li>
<li>Quiff		The quiff combines the 1950s pompadour hairstyle, the 1950s flat-top, and, sometimes a mohawk. T
he hairstyle was an essential in the British 'Teddy Boy' movement, and became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s and
 2010s. Recently examples of people wearing quiffs are Alex Turner and Matt Helders of Arctic Monkeys, Tom Meighan of Kasabian,
 Eugene McGuinness, Bruno Mars, Nick Grimshaw, and One Direction</li>
	<li>El Siete, or, El 7 Colombiano[3] (The Seven)		Originated in Medellín, Colombia as a variation on the 
'mullet'.[4][5] Right angles in the shape of the number "7" are shaved into the sides of the head, while the rest of the hair remains uniform in length.</li>
<li>Shape-up		Also called a "line-up". Hair that has an even line across the forehead and then turns sharply at a 90-degree angle and blend
	s with the sideburns. It can be worn with almost any other hairstyle. Primarily worn by Latinos and some African Americans. Well-known examples include Canadian hip-hop artist Drake and Vinny Guadagnino from MTV's Jersey Shore.
<li>Skin fade		Similar to a typical fade, except the hair is faded down to the skin.</li>
<li>Slicked-back		Hair that is combed back, away from the forehead, then held in place with a hairstyling product.</li>
<li>Titus cut		A short layered cut, typically with curls. Popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</li>
<li>Tonsure		Traditionally worn by monks in the Middle Ages, still worn by some traditional monks today.</li>
<li>Undercut		The undercut is a gendered haircut whereby the top section of hair is held in place whilst the side and back sections are cut, thus making the top longer and the back and sides undercutting. See also bowl cut
	<li>Waves		Short-haired waves, shortened to just waves, is a very common and sought after hairstyle for African-American men that create the appearance of water-like waves in the hair.
<li>Wings		This style can range from long and hanging below the eyes, to a shorter length. Instead of lying on the wearer
's ears, the hair flips up and comes straight out like an airplane wing, hence the name. Popular amongst the skateboarding, surfer
 and preppy communities. Also known as a 'mod cut'.</li>
