<h4>Long hairstyles</h4>
<ol>
<a href="https://www.byrdie.com/quick-and-easy-hairstyles-for-long-hair-5114705"target="_blank">Long hairstyles</a> may be considered those which reach beyond the shoulders on women, or require long hair to create, and past the chin on men.

Name		      Description
<li>Afro		A style of natural African hair that has been grown out without any straightening or ironing, and combed regularly with special afro picks. In recent history, the hairstyle was popular through the late 1960s and 1970s in the United States.
<li>Beehive		Backcombing or teasing with hairspray to style hair on top of the head so that the size and shape is suggestive of a beehive, hence the name.
<li>Bangs		Bangs (or fringe) straight across the high forehead, or cut at a slight U-shape.
<li>Big hair		Any hairstyle with large volume, though this is generally a description given to hair with a straight texture that is blown out or "teased" into a large size. The increased volume is often maintained with the use of hairspray or other styling products that offer hold.
<li>Blowout		A long hairstyle for women that is used with rich products and blown dry from the roots to the ends. Popularized by individuals such as Catherine, Princess of Wales
<li>Brush cut		Brush cut is an alternative name for a longer butch cut, especially one that shows natural curl.
<li>Bun		A hairstyle where the hair is arranged into a knot, usually at the back, crown, or top of the head. See also chignon.
<li>Chignon		A specific type of bun that is smoothly wrapped at the base of the neck.
<li>Croydon facelift		A tight ponytail worn at the top of the head, giving the effect of a facelift as it pulls the facial skin upwards. Often inappropriately referred to as a "top knot" (though this term, in its original context, actually refers to a chonmage).
<li>Crown braid
	A crown braid or crown plait is a traditional hairstyle usually worn by women with long hair, consisting of a braid wrapped up around the head. It is the signature hairstyle worn by Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko. It is also similar to some of the hairstyles worn by Frida Kahlo. See also braid or plait.
<li>Double buns		Two buns worn at either side of the head, popularized by Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) of Star Wars fame.
<li>Devilock		The sides and back are kept short while the front is grown long and combed forward. Well known in certain punk rock subcultures due to its use being commonly associated to Misfits bassist Jerry Only.
<li>Fallera hairdo		A Valencian fallera hairstyle is a traditional women's hairstyle typical of Valencia and its Falles celebration, and is reminiscent of the "Princess Leia hairstyle" of Star Wars fame. It is an elaborate hairstyle consisting of two spiralled buns on either side of the head and two braids blew around the back of the head, with twisted strands of hair in different forms in the middle of the braids. This hairstyle is reminiscent of the one found on the ancient statue of the Lady of Elx.
<li>Flipped-up ends		A women's style that was popular in the 1960s. Characterized by upward curling ("flipped") ends. Cybill Shepherd wore it as a beauty queen in 1966.
<li>Feathered hair		Feathered hair was popular in the 1970s and the early 1980s with both men and women. The hair was grown long on both sides (normally covering the ears, although it could be down to the shoulders), left unlayered (although some men with curly hair did have it layered) with either a side or a center parting.
<li>Fontange		A hairstyle popular in the second half of the 17th century.
<li>French braid		A French braid is a braid that appears to be braided "into" the hair, often described as braided backwardsâ€”strands, going over instead of under as in a Dutch braid.
<li>French twist		A hairstyle wherein the hair is twisted behind the head into a sort of bun style.
<li>Fringe (bangs)		Hair that is combed to the front of the head and cut at or above the eyebrows.
<li><li>Gretchenfrisur 		Braided hairstyle popular with German women, in which the hair is braided and piled atop the head.
<li>Half crown		Alternative and historic name for a semi-short taper.
<li>Half updo		Popularized in the 1960s by sex icons like Brigitte Bardot, this women's hairstyle requires medium-length or longer hair. The hair is divided from the temples back and then fixed into bun, chignon or ponytail to secure into place (therefore, half the hair is in an 'updo'). If a woman has a fringe, that area is usually left free and never pulled into the 'updo'.
<li>Hime cut		A Japanese hairstyle that consists of long straight hair that reaches at least below the shoulder blades with part of it cut to about shoulder-length and a fringe (bangs) that reaches the eyebrows.
<li>Jewfro		A Jewish variant of the 'Afro' hairstyle.
<li>Jheri curl		Hair that is curly and kept moist (or at least a wet-look maintained) by a Jheri curl activator. This style was popular in the 1980s especially with African-Americans, including Michael Jackson and Rick James.
<li>Layered hair		A women's hairstyle where different sections of the hair are cut at different lengths to give the impression of layers.
<li>Liberty spikes		Hair that is grown out long and spiked up usually with a gel
<li>Lob		A shoulder-length hairstyle for women, much like a long bob, hence the name.
<li>Mullet		Hair that is short in front and long in the back. Often described as "Business in the front, party in the back".
<li>Odango		A hairstyle where two buns are worn on either side of the head, with the rest of the hair worn as pigtails. Most well-known example of this style is worn by the titular character of the Japanese anime Sailor Moon. In African-American culture, commonly referred to as "afro puffs."
<li>Oseledets		A haircut consisting of a long tuft or lock of hair left on top of the shaven head, associated with Cossacks. Ukrainian professional boxer and former undisputed world cruiserweight and heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has worn Oseledets during some of his professional boxing matches, including during Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua II.
<li>Payot		Sidelocks or earlocks, worn by some males in the Orthodox Jewish community.
<li>Perm		Hair that is chemically treated to retain curl (curly perm) or lie straight (straight perm). New hair is not affected by the chemical treatment and will grow out naturally.
<li>Pigtails		Hair that is divided into two equal sections and is then either braided or secured close to the scalp and left to hang free.
<li>Ponyhawk		1. A combination of a mohawk with a ponytail in the back.
 Long hair worn in several ponytails running from front of the head to the back of the head resembling a mohawk. Unlike a usual mohawk, hair is not cut from the sides. The word is a portmanteau of 'ponytail' and 'mohawk'.

<li>Ponytail		When all of the hair is collected and fixed with a hair tie or clip close to the scalp, with the hair hanging free, resembling the tail of a pony.
<li>Psychobilly Wedge		The Psychobilly Wedge is a sort of a mixture between a mohawk hairstyle and the pompadour. The hair along the side of the head is shaved and the middle is not spiked but slicked back and fashioned in a pompadour.
<li>Queue		Hair is worn long and gathered up into a ponytail, often braided. It was worn traditionally by the Manchu people of Manchuria (and their male Han Chinese subjects during the Qing dynasty) and certain Native American groups.
<li>The Rachel		A square-layered haircut popularized by Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green) on the 1990s sitcom Friends.
<li>Rattail		Hair that has been grown out long and shorn, or 'buzzed' except for a long, thin braid at the very top of the neck.
<li>Razor cut		Includes choppy short layers, thinned at the bottom. Not dissimilar from "emo" hair. Usually has a side-sweep fringe.
<li>Ringlets		A tightly curled hairstyle.
<li>Shag cut		A choppy layered hairstyle, characterized by layers to create fullness in the crown and fringes around the edges. There are many versions including the frat shag and boy's shag. In the 2020s, a variation of the shag called a wolf cut became popular. This variation differentiates itself by being shorter at the front in a style reminiscent of the mullet and often includes bangs. The wolf cut has been worn by celebrities including Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus.
<li>Shingle bob		A dome-shaped short haircut with the bottom razored into a V shape.
<li>Step cut		A measured style in which the hair takes the form of cascading steps.
