<h3><li>Know Your Hair Type</li></h3>
<p>Getting to know your <a href="https://www.avenuefive.edu/how-to-identity-your-hair-type-a-detailed-guide/#:~:text=Hair%20type%20
has%204%20major,Type%201B%20Straight%20Hair"target="_blank">hair</a> can prevent you from wreaking havoc on innocent strands. So, before you pick up a heating tool or brush,
 learn to distinguish your hair type. Hair typically falls under two categories: Fine and thick.Your hair is fine if a single strand is
 hard to see; you struggle with maintaining volume; and locks never feel heavy. You have fewer strands, which are super skinny.
 Your hair is thick if it feels coarser; bobby pins can’t hold styles in place; and your biggest problem is taming frizz. You
 seem to have an infinite amount of strands and they weigh a ton.</p>

<h3><li>Start With A Good Haircut</li></h3>
<p>Regular haircuts aren't just for removing dead ends — they can also make your hair appear thicker and full of life
. A good haircut also provides a good foundation for executing any hairstyle you desire.
Have flat hair that could use a little more bounce? "Try face-framing layers and short, soft layers to boost volume,
" says Jenny Cho, Suave Professionals celebrity stylist.
When it comes to thick hair, Edward Tricomi, master stylist and co-owner of Warren-Tricomi Salons, recommends growing your
 hair long with density-lessening layers or lopping it off. Just avoid shoulder-length cuts — those can look too boxy and chunky, he says.<br><img src="C:\Users\Administr

<h3><li><a href="https://cremeofnature.com/products/"target="_blank">Choose hair products based on hair thickness</a></li></h3>
<p>The foundation for healthy, luscious hair begins with a shampoo and conditioner formulated for your hair type, along with a
 deep-conditioning treatment for weekly blasts of moisture. One important takeaway when it comes to products: Different hair 
types have various needs.
"Someone with fine, straight hair might want more lightweight formulas like mists and sprays because heavy conditioners migh
t weight hair down," says Danusia Wnek, chemist at the GH Beauty Lab.
Someone with thick, curly hair, on the opposite end, might want richer oils and thick creams to lubricate strands and
 might not worry about weigh down. "Selecting products specific to your hair type ensures that formulators and product 
developers have kept your hair type in mind when creating products," Wnek adds.</p>

<h3><li>Become styling product-savvy</li></h3>
<p>Styling products may be different in nature, but one thing remains the same: A little goes a long way.
 Always start with an itty-bitty amount and add more if needed.
• Hair gels are more liquid-y to the touch, but they dry quickly into a shiny (almost “wet”-like) hard shell. They’re
 best for creating spikes on short hair, slicking hair down, and defining curls.
• Hair mousse is a lighter styling foam that gives a crunch-free, volumous look. Our Beauty Lab experts recommend the 
John Frieda Volume Lift Air Whipped Foam because it showed superior performance when tested in increased humidity over
 a period of time.
• Other finishing products, like creams and serums, are the lightest of the bunch and perfect for last-minute touch ups.
 Lastly, Cho says she always has a bottle of hair oil in her makeup bag. Described as an all-in-one miracle product, it
 penetrates the cuticle, heals damage, calms frizz, and adds luster.<br><img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\haircream.jpg"></p>
